### Before setting up and running the bot, you must first create the bot the discord developer portal. 
- If you are unfamilar on how to do this, here is a youtube video to help with the process: [How to Video](https://youtu.be/Uibz0iQjoC0?t=714). 

- After setting up the bot in the portal and getting the token, you want to save it on your local computer in a txt file.

- The token will need to be put in place in the token variable in the code.
    
#### After you have done these steps you can now run the bot. If you have done everything correct you should see it active on the server.

#### If you get stuck please feel free to reach out. [My Discord Server](https://discord.gg/2vBYTr32) or email me at nhinds1988@gmail.com
